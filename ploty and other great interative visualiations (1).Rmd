### Import the data file

```{r}
# Read CSV, note the delimiter (sep)
# remark the seperated signal
# if no head define than it is thinking the header is true

```

```{r}
#Read CSV, note the delimiter (sep)
df <- read.csv("ploty and other great interative visualiations (1).csv", sep=';')
head(df)

```


```{r}
# check the summary of the data file
summary(df)
```

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
# checking if there any null values
any(is.na(df))
```

```{r}

# checking the catagorical feature
# structure of the data file
str(df)
```

# install the library ggtheme is for showing the various theme in your projects.

####Correlation (wikipedia)
**In statistics, dependence or association is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or two sets of data. Correlation is any of a broad class of statistical relationships involving dependence, though in common usage it most often refers to the extent to which two variables have a linear relationship with each other. Familiar examples of dependent phenomena include the correlation between the physical statures of parents and their offspring, and the correlation between the demand for a product and its price.**


```{r}
# Correlation plots are a great way of exploring data and seeing if there are any interaction terms. Let's start off by just grabbing the numeric data (we can't see correlation for categorical data):

# Grab only numeric columns
(num.cols <- sapply(df, is.numeric))

# Filter to numeric columns for correlation
(cor.data <- cor(df[,num.cols]))

cor.data
```


**While working with data this is a best practice to see the correlation within the variables either in matrix format or in the graphical format**

```{r}
# visualization the correlation in a dataframe, within the numerical variables

corrplot(cor.data,method='color')
```


# Interective visualization

**Examples of using the plotly with a normal ggplot2**

```{r}

# normal ggplot2 function in mtcar data set
library(ggplot2)
pl<-ggplot(mtcars,aes(mpg,wt))+geom_point()
print(pl)
```


```{r}
# using plotly in the mtcars data set 
# color wise display

library(plotly)

q<-qplot(x=mpg, y=wt, data=mtcars, color=disp)
gpl<-ggplotly(q)
print(gpl)

```


```{r}
# adding the size in the above data set
# based on the hp
library(plotly)
tempdata<-mtcars
q<-qplot(x=mpg, y=wt,z=cyl, data=mtcars, color=disp, size=hp)
gpl<-ggplotly(q)
print(gpl)


```


```{r}

# 3d display using the plotly
# different color is different cylender
# x and y axis is same as before

plot_ly(mtcars, x=~mpg,y=~wt,z=~qsec,type="scatter3d",mode="makers",color=~cyl)
```
